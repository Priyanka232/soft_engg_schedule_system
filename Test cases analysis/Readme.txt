                                                   Test cases analysis :

1. Basic assumptions :
                      - Internet is working continuously, and server is working at perfect condition.
                      - Input is submitted by clicking on submit or any such available button.
                      - Test cases are made manually.

2. Basic outcomes :
                   - It has been seen there are no errors occuring on refreshing any page, exitting in between, etc.
                   - Mysql injection cant be done. 
                   - The changes have been properly transfered to database.
                   - Upon entering urls directly without proper authentication you will be sent back to home page.

3. Individual fuctionality testing :
                                    - Assuming the input until reaching that functionality was successful. (Obvious from basic outcomes)
                                    - The testing was carried out manually.
                                    - The test cases along with result have been placed in the Test cases analysis.xlsx file.
                                    - It has been observed that it gave 100% desired output without crashing, errors or failures.

4. Combined fuctionality testing : 
                                  - Upon manual testing with inclusion of combined individual test cases and since individual functionality testing gave 100% desired result, gave 100% desired output.
                                  - There has been no crashing, errors or failures.
                                  - Results have been placed in Combined functionalities testing.xlsx file.

5. Conclusion :
               - Testing proved that the webware was 100% error free, and always gave desired output.
